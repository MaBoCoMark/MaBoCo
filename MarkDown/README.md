## Footnote Notes:
>How to: [^Footnote] with a [^Footnote]: Footnote discription
```
Note: The position of a footnote in your Markdown does not 
influence where the footnote will be rendered. You can write 
a footnote right after your reference to the footnote, and 
the footnote will still render at the bottom of the Markdown.
```
